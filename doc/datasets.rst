Publically available ZS datasets
================================

The v2 Google Books eng-us-all n-grams are here:
    http://cpl-data.ucsd.edu/zs/

The `zscontrib <https://github.com/njsmith/zscontrib>`_ repository has
some scripts to fetch an arbitrary v2 Google Books sub-corpus and
build it into a set of .zs files.
